The javascript above posts the form above after the number of milliseconds you specify. The same thing happens on computer-timed test trials (see test.php). I could have accomplished this using <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="300; url='feedback.php'"> but it wouldn't record the data that way (i.e., it wouldn't post anything).
