OVERVIEWThis program will present and/or test a bunch of questions. It can do a single session or multiple sessions. The stimuli can be words, pictures, etc.; basically, anything you can put in html. CONTROL FILESThe program can be controlled using two files, called Words1.txt and Order1.txt (although it's not always 1). Make sure you maintain the format they currently use (i.e., number of columns, capitalization). See below for details.  WORDS FILEPut in the question/answer pairs. You can also put in html tags (so you can show pictures, etc). A last column allows you to record whatever info you want about the stimuli in that line (e.g., "easy" or "difficult"). You can use different stimuli for different participants, if you want, by creating multiple word files (e.g., Words1.txt, Words2.txt, etc.). You also have to change the value of the "numWordFiles" variable in login.php. If you do, it will choose a wordFile randomly for each participant. You can also choose to shuffle the words before they are assigned to conditions (by setting the shuffleWords variable to True in login.php). Doing so will make the program assign words to the item numbers in the orderfile randomly. ORDER FILE The orderfile is where you control the procedure of your experiment. Make a row for every trial you want the participant to experience. Each row needs to have an item number in it, which determines which stimulus to show. The same item can be repeated. If you choose to shuffle, the words will be randomly assigned to the numbers in the first column. You can have different procedures for different participants by creating multiple orderfiles (e.g., Order1.txt, Order2.txt) and setting the variable "numOrderFiles" in login.php. If you set it to have multiple orderfiles, it will assign them based on the number of subjects who have completed the experiment so far (which it keeps track of in LoginCounter.txt), so that every condition will get roughly the same number of participants. Using the order file(s) you can determine, on each trial, the following:-- which item number is presented-- read vs copy vs test trials-- feedback vs no feedback trials-- user timed versus computer timed trials-- a last column allows you to record whatever info you want about the trial (e.g., initialStudy phase). MULTIPLE SESSIONSIt's pretty easy to do multiple sessions. You just put a line in the orderfile that says *newfile*. Then you put in what you want in the next file. You can make as many files as you want. During session 1 it will create them all. Each file controls a different session. If you want to have people complete the second session, you can send them a link (see below). If you don't want multiple sessions, just don't have a *newfile* line. All of the data from all of the sessions will be saved in the same file (assuming it's still in the subjects folder, which is where the data are saved). ASSIGNING LOGIN AND SESSION VIA EMAILIf it's a user's first day, you can send the subject to the index page, and there they will create a new login. The program will send them to the login page and it will assume that it's session 1 for that subject. But if they've done it before, you can send them a link that skips the index file. In the link, you can specify their login and session. So for example, if it's the Generic program, and the login is skippyjoe and the session is 2, you'd have them click this link: http://www.cogfog.com/Generic/login.php?username=skippyjoe&sessionnum=2. For session 3, just change it to 3, etc. PROGRAM SETTINGSIn addition to the parameters that can be controlled in the order file (e.g., trial type) there are a number of parameters that are easily modified in the code, such as how long trials last, in the file called login.php.STEPPING OUTYou can step out of the study/test trials if you want to. Doing so will send the program to whatever page is specified in the extra information column of the orderfile (see example below). Presumably that page will take the subject to feedback.php whenever it's done doing whatever it does (going to feedback.php makes the program resume running trials where it left off). The program already includes a few handy stepout files, one of which does timed free recall (and records the data), and another of which has them count backwards. But you can modify them or make your own. You just put a line in the order file with the following format (the key is to say StepOut in column 2 and to identify the page to step to in column 5): 0	StepOut	NA	NA	soStudy.htmlINVISIBLE LINESIf different items appear different numbers of times it can make data analysis annoyingly difficult. This is rarely an issue. But I put in a capacity to show lines in the datafile without showing them in the program. Use this format (the key is to say invisible in column 2 and have the item number in column 1): 1	invisible	NA	NA	NARECORDING DATAIf you want, you can make use of the last column in Words.txt and Order.txt: Whatever you put there will show up in the datafile associated with that item (for words) or trial (for order). It won't be used in the program (unless it says StepOut, see above), it's just for the purpose of tracking data.SPECIFIC PROGRAM NOTES(adjust these for your experiment)PRELOADING IMAGESThis program isn't setup for images (the changes are trivial, though, and others are). But here's code that can be used to pre-load images if you ever do want to use images. This is taken from Spinch02.####### The code below preloads the next picture. #######// Figure out which picture to preload.$tempCatName = $_SESSION['testArray'][$_SESSION['globalCounter']][1]; # note these don't have -1 because they're for the next trial$tempCatNum = $_SESSION['testArray'][$_SESSION['globalCounter']][0];if ($_SESSION['repeatItems'] == "Repeated") {	$itemToShow = 5;} else {	$itemToShow = $_SESSION['categoryCounter'][$tempCatNum]; }echo '<div style="display:none;"><img src=images/'.$tempCatName.'/'.$itemToShow.'.jpg>#<img src="pic1.jpg" /><img src="pic2.jpg" /></div>';
