<h3>
	You will now take a test. </h3>
	<p>
	Earlier in this study, you were shown a list of word pairs. You will now be cued with the first word, and be asked to recall the second word.
	<p> You will see each word pair (or more accurately, first word-_______) twice. 
	<p>The first time you see a cued word, please type in what the CORRECT answer was (i.e. what the computer presented to you). 
	The second time you see the cued word, please enter in what your initial GUESS had been (i.e. the word that you typed previously). 
	Note that this will occur for word pairs that you both had to guess and which you simply read. 
	If it is a word that you simply read instead of making guesses, type "read" in the second blank.
	When you have entered in the answer, or if you cannot remember the answer, please hit the 'submit' button. 
	
	<p>For example, let's say that in the study phase, you were given: Cat: _______ and you guessed "Dog" but the correct answer was "Kitten". 
	In the test phase then, when you see Cat: ______, you would first type in "Kitten" and hit 'submit'. You will then see Cat: _____ again, and enter in "dog" and hit 'submit'. 
	<p> Now let's say that in the study phase, you only saw Cat: Kitten, and were not asked to guess anything.
	In the test phase then, when you see Cat: ______, you would first type in "Kitten" and hit 'submit'. Then you will see Cat:____ again, and enter in "read" and hit 'submit'.
	
	<p> Therefore, remember to type in the correct answer first, and then your guess if you made one or 'read' if you did not make a guess.
	<p> Please let the experimenter know if these instructions are not clear.
